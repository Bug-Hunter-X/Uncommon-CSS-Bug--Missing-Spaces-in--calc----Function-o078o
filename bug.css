The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on CSS values. However, there is a common error where spaces are missing between the operators and the operands in the `calc()` function, resulting in unexpected behavior or parse errors. For example, the following code will result in an error:

```css
.element { width:calc(100%-10px); }
```

The correct syntax should have spaces between the operators and the operands:

```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }
```
