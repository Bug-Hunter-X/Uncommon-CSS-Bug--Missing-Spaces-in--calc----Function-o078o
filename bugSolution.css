The solution is to ensure there are spaces between the operators and operands within the `calc()` function.  The following code demonstrates the correct syntax:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  height: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```
This version correctly calculates the width and height, taking into account the spacing around the operators.
